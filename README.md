# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
#02-Week-Challenge (Portfolio)

## Description
I completed the interactive component of this webpage using JavaScript in order to allow the user to generate a random password containing 5 criteria: password length, and the choice of 4 character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters). This project showcases the skills that I have learned in JavaScript. This webpage specifically highlights the addition of an Event Listener (functional button that initiates the JavaScript code to generate a random and original password), function writing, else if statements, for loop, confirm(), alert(), and prompt() components. I learned how to debug a complicated else if statement by randomizing and combining arrays with element.concat() in order to include the multiple character types in one new original array, displayed as the user's random password.

## Installation

This webpage can be accessed on Github Pages, at the link:

## Usage

Once the webpage has been accessed using the Installation guidelines above, the user can hover their cursor over the "Generate Password" button and click to trigger the prompts that allow the user to select their password critieria. The user first enters the number of characters they would like the password to contain, between 8 and 128. If the user selects a number less than 8 or greater than 128, they will receive an alert reminding them to choose a character amount between 8-128, and a result "undefined" will appear in the text box. The user will need to begin again and select a character amount between 8-128. After selecting an appropriate character length, the user will be prompted to complete four "yes or no" questions to choose which characters they would like their password to contain. The user will click OK or CANCEL to confirm or deny the use of the four character types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. If the user selects CANCEL for all four character types, the user will receive an alert that they will need to begin again and select at least one of these character types. The text box will then reveal an "undefined" result. If the user selects an appropriate character amount and at least one character type, a randomized password with those defined criteria will appear in the text box.
